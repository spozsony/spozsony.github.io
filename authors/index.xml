      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my personal website! My name is Sofia Pozsonyiova, and I am currently a first-generation undergraduate student at Macalester College. I am about to enter my senior year, and am majoring in applied mathematics &amp;amp; statistics with a focus on community and global health. After completing my Bachelor of Science, I hope to pursue a further degree in biostatistics and or health data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current research involves the integration of statistical classification techniques to spectra data, with the goal being to effectively bridge machine learning methods and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy results. If you have any questions about my research or in general any experiences, please get in contact with me. My email can be found on the bottom of this website, and or can be located by my icon. I can also be found on LinkedIn and GitHub. If you are interested in learning more about me, check out the full introduction!&lt;/p&gt;
