      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sofia Pozsonyiova is an applied mathematics and statistics student finishing up her last year of undergraduate studies at Macalester College. Her research primarily focuses on integrating machine learning and statistics methods to improve the interpretation and classification of laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) data. Sofia began working with LIBS back in 2017, and since then has pioneered new tools to better handle data generated via laser spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through her various experiences and courses, Sofia has solidified that she wants to continue to work with and innovate statistical analysis in her future career. However, she wants to gear her research towards public health and focus on improving patient care by improving treatment and diagnostic tests using statistical modeling and machine learning. With goal being to one day help create new innovative solutions to help solve some of public healthâ€™s most pressing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
