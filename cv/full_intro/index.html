<p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Sofia Pozsonyiova, and I am currently a first-generation undergraduate student at Macalester College. I am about to enter my senior year and am majoring in applied mathematics &amp; statistics with a focus on community and global health. After completing my Bachelor of Science, I hope to pursue a further degree in biostatistics and or health data science.</p>

<p>A little about me; As the last name may have already hinted at, I was actually born in Slovakia, and moved to the United States at a young age. I grew up in South Florida and decided to switch things up and move to Minnesota for my undergraduate studies. I know what you're probably thinking, "Why on earth would I ever trade the warmth?"! Well, let me tell you I ask myself that very same question every winter, but I would not have it any other way. At Macalester, I was able to find that my true passion lies in statistics and public health, so I am thankful for that opportunity. However, when I am not studying or working, I am involved with two outside organizations in the Twin - Cities; Rladies (Team R all the way!) and Women in Machine learning &amp; Data Science. In addition, I am an avid NPR &ldquo;How I built this&rdquo; listener, and probably spend more time than I should watching the food network.</p>

<p>My current research involves the integration of machine learning techniques to spectra data, with the goal being to effectively bridge statistical modeling/machine learning methods and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy results. If you have any questions about my research and any experiences, feel free to send me an email. I am always looking forward to meeting new people, so again please reach out! My email can be found on the bottom of this website, and or can be located by my icon. I can also be found on LinkedIn and GitHub.</p>
